        <p><b>Pseudocode</b> is the use of less technical words or plain understandable language to describe how an algorithm should work. It is often used as a planning and communication tool before writing actual code. Pseudocode has no syntax, but has some rules;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>capitalise key commands</li>
            <li>write one statement per line</li>
            <li>use indentation and spacing</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Pseudocode example</b></p>
        <br>
        <pre class="line-numbers">
            <code class="language-javascript">
                // 1. Reading List
/* Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

 Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties
 for the title(a string), author(a string), and already read(a boolean indicating if you read it yet).

 Iterate through the array of books.For each book, log the book title and book author
 like so: “The Hobbit by J.R.R.Tolkien”.

 Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read
 it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like ‘You already read “The Hobbit”
 by J.R.R. Tolkien’, and if not, log a string like ‘You still need to read “The
 Lord of the Rings” by J.R.R. Tolkien.’*/

 // Pseudocode
 // declare a variable called books
// make it an array
// create an object consisting of title, author and already read for each book
// initialise i = 0
// loop while i < books length
// assign book to books[i]
// assign book info to book.title and book.author
// if book.alreadyread
// output you already read 
// else 
// output you still need to read

        <p><b>Comments</b></p>
        <p>In programming, a <b>comment</b> is a piece of text that is added to the source code of a program to provide
            information, explanations, or notes to other developers or to oneself. Comments are not executed or interpreted by
            the computer and do not affect the behavior or functionality of the program.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In JavaScript, you can use two types of comments: <b>single-line comments</b> and <b>multi-line comments</b>.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Single-line comments</b> start with <code class="language-javascript">//</code> and continue until the end of the line. They are used to add explanatory or descriptive text to specific lines of code. Here's an example:</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
// This is a single-line comment
var number = 10; // Assigning the value 10 to the variable 'number'

            </code>
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p><b>Multi-line comments</b> start with <code class="language-javascript">/*</code> and end with <code class="language-javascript">*/</code>. They can span multiple lines and are often used to provide longer explanations or to temporarily disable blocks of code. Here's an example:</p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
*/
var result = add(5, 3); /* Function call to add() */

            </code>
        </pre>
